## Xel.Ra's Guide to automatic grinding in AFO ##
#################################################

* Make sure you run Windows XP/Vista/7

* Install BlueStacks App Player (You can download it here http://bluestacks.com)
* Install Avatar Fight Online inside of BlueStacks App Player

* Install AutoHotkey (You can download it here http://www.autohotkey.com/)

* Write all your account credentials into the included Credentials.csv file in this format (use Notepad or similar, NOT EXCEL!): 
<pre>"<Account name>","<Password>","<Number of mines>"</pre>. Clean the file up. Remove examples.

* Load the included .ahk-script with AutoHotkey
* Go to your AFO main screen (where you can see the Logout-button)
* Press F1

The script only listens for a single key. Press F1 to run the script.
Make sure you press F1 from the main window of AFO when logged in.

Upon pressing the F1-button the script will log you out and then login with the supplied credentials. It will then go into the land screen and do its magic on the mines.

DON'T OVERWRITE YOUR EXISTING "Credentials.csv"!!!!

F2 reloads the script. You can also break execution by pressing F2.

F3 isn't really complete. So don't use it.
